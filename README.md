Many Images from RetroArch assets used in textures.xbt  and others i gathered from various google images searches.

backgrounds folder is full of wallpaper taken from images of Digital CyberCherries New Retro Arcade Neon interface.(These are temporary until i can find stock photos or am granted permission to use. )


Neon Sonic pictured above ive used and hope to continue using pretty much as a brand is by GreenMachine987

The vast majority of console art that will be used as system showcase art is adopted from my favorite
RetroPie EmulationStation Theme by HerbFargus TronkyFran.

i forked the theme on Github and intend on gutting it and organizing it similiar to a addon with a licence file
and a readme that will give proper credit an thanks.   in the meantime this will have to suffice.

Otis my team mate from Mancave Builds gets credit and thanks for a couple of the textures i used and the neXtBoX logo i will be using as the skins icon.png

and last but definitely not least the neXtBoX theme/skin itself is a fork of the beautiful and sexy Nebula 
Kodi skin by:  Tgxcorporation

He's, in my opinion the best skin creator Kodi has seen.   Black Glass and Chroma are also works of his and
among if not the best availible.




Thank you to all of the aforementioned.




#Note: I will update this readme with better screenshots of 
       build and try to keep a decent change log on the progess of the skin.
